# packy

Packy is a mod made for [ModFest: Singularity](https://modfest.net) that adds backpacks that let you access your ender chest, anywhere.

Code partly stolen from [Server Backpacks](https://github.com/Oliver-makes-code/server-backpacks), which was not updated for 1.19.

## Why ender chests?

- No breaking the game with storing a kjghillion items in one chest
- It was the first idea I came up with and one feature only
- ~~Makes my life easier~~
